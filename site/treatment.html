      Schizoaffective disorder is treated and managed in several ways: <br>
Doctors and other mental health professionals will often prescribe medications to relieve symptoms of psychosis, stabilize mood and treat depression. The only medication approved by the FDA to treat Schizoaffective disorder is the antipsychotic drug paliperidone (Invega).
However, some medications approved for the treatment of other mental health conditions may be helpful for Schizoaffective disorder. These medications include:
<ul>
  <li><strong class="underline">Antipsychotics:</strong> A health care provider will prescribe antipsychotics to relieve symptoms of psychosis, such as delusions and hallucinations.</li>
  <li><strong class="underline">Antidepressants:</strong> When Schizoaffective disorder is depressive-type antidepressants can alleviate feelings of sadness, despair and trouble concentrating.</li>
  <li><strong class="underline">Mood Stabilizers:</strong> When bipolar disorder is the underlying mood disorder, mood stabilizers can help stabilizers the highs and lows.</li>
</ul>

<center><strong class="sub-heading">Psychotherapy</strong></center>
Family involvement, psychosocial strategies, self-care peer support, psychotherapy and integrated care for co-occurring substance abuse can all be part of an individual support plan.
  Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps change the negative thinking and behavior associated with feelings of depression. The goal of this therapy is to recognize negative thoughts and to teach coping strategies.
    With conditions like Schizoaffective disorder that have symptoms of psychosis, additional cognitive therapy is added to basic CBT (CBTp). CBTp helps people develop coping strategies for persistent symptoms that do not respond to medicine.

For cases where medication and psychotherapy do not work for a person with Schizoaffective disorder, ECT may be worth considering. ECT involves transmitting short electrical impulse into the brain. Although ECT is a highly effective treatment for severe depression, it is not the first choice in treating Schizoaffective disorder.

<strong class="smaller-heading">Help Yourself:</strong>
If you have Schizoaffective disorder, the condition can control your thoughts, interfere with relationships and if not treated, lead to a crisis. Here are some ways to help manage your illness:
<ul>
<li><strong class="underline">Pinpoint Your Stressors and Triggers:</strong>
  Are there specific times when you find yourself stressed? People, places, jobs and even holidays can play a big role in your mood stability. Symptoms of mania and depression may start slow, but addressing them early can prevent a serious episode.
Feelings of mania may feel good at first, but they can spiral into dangerous behavior such as reckless driving, violence or hypersexuality. Depression may begin with feeling tired and being unable to sleep.
</li>
<li> <strong class="underline"> Avoid Drugs and Alcohol:</strong>
  Substance aduse is common with Schizoaffective Disorder but using these substances can disturb emotional balance and interact with medications. Both depression and mania make drugs and alcohol attractive options and help you "slow down" or "perk up," but the potential damage can block your recovery.
</li>
<li><strong class="underline">Establish A Routine:</strong>
  Commiting to a routine can help you take control and help prevent depression and mania from taking control. For example, to keep the energy changes caused by depressed and mania in check, commit to being in bed only eight hours a night and up and moving the rest of the time.
</li>
<li><strong class="underline">Form Healthy Relationships:</strong>
  Relationships can help stabilize your moods. An outgoing friend might encourage you to get involved with social activities and lift your mood. A more relaexed friend may provide you with a steady calm that can help keep feelings of mania under control.
</li>
<li><strong class="underline">Strategies and Education:</strong>
  Learning strategies to manage the symptoms of your disorder are critical. Coping strategies may also include work-and-school rehabilitation and social skills training. Studies have shown that Act cnan reduce hospitalizations for people with Schizoaffective disorder and Schizophrenia by 20%.

<ul>
 <li><strong class="underline">Recognize Early Symptoms:</strong>
  You may be able to prevent a serious episode of the illness before it happens. Symptoms of mania and depression often have warning signs. The beginnings of mania typically feels good and that means your family member may not want to seek help. Identify signals such as lack of sleep and speaking quickly that signall impending mania. A deep depression often begins with low mood, feeling fatigued or having trouble sleeping.
</li>
  <li><strong class="underline">Communicate:</strong>
    Not everyone enjoys confronting problems head on, but doing so is critical to healthy communication. Make time to talk about problems, but know that not just any time is right. For example, if your family member has bipolar II and becomes angry, it might be safe to try and talk through the situation. But, if your friend with bipolar I becomes angry, your reaction may need to be different. It's more likely that this anger will turn to rage and become dangerous, including physical violence.
  </li>
<li><strong class="underline">React Calmly and Rationally:</strong>
  Even in situations where your family member of friend may "go off," ranting at you or others, it's imporant to remain calm. Listen to them and make them feel understood, then try to work towards a positive outcome.
</li>
</ul>

  <strong class="underline">Cultural Considerations:</strong>
Research has shown that African Americans and Latinos are more likely to be misdiagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder, so people who have been diagnosed should make sure that their mental health professional understands their background and shares their expectations for treatment.
