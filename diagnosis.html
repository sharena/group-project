<p>Schizoaffective disorder can be difficult to diagnose because it has symptoms of both Schizophrenia and either depression or bipolar disorder. There are two major types of Schizoaffective disorder: bipolar type and depression type. To be diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder a person must have the following symptoms:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> A period during which there is a major mood disrder, either depression or mania, that occurs at the same time that symptoms of Schizophrenia are present.</li>
  <li>Delusions or hallucinations for two or more weeks in the absence of a major mood episode.</li>
  <li>Symptoms that meet criteria for a major mood episode are present for the majority of the total duration of the illness.</li>
  <li> The abuse of the  drugs or a medication are not responsible for the symptoms.</li>
</ul>
